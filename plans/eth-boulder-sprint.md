## Key Context

### The Formation Story (from Nou Bot's synthesis)
- **14 meetings over 6 months** across two phases
- **Phase 1 (Aug–Oct 2025):** Conceptual foundation — "Soil, Not Enterprise"
- **Phase 2 (Nov 2025–Jan 2026):** Structural finalization — Dual entity solution

### Dual Entity Structure
- **Entity 1: RegenHub Co-op** — Partnership-taxed LCA for people and place (2nd floor)
- **Entity 2: Venture Studio (Techne)** — Corporation-taxed LCA for organizations and capital (3rd floor)

### Mission
Cultivate **Scenius** (collective intelligence through mutual inspiration) and reinvest profits via community grants.
