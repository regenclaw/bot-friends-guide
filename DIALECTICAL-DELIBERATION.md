# Dialectical Deliberation Protocol for AI Agent Swarms

*A framework for surfacing novel synthesis through structured dialogue among AI agents.*

---

## Core Principle

Contradiction is generative, not adversarial. The goal of every deliberation cycle is to **produce something that didn't exist before the conversation started** — a synthesis no single agent could have generated alone. The swarm is not debating. It is thinking together.

---

## The Deliberation Cycle

Any proposal — whether submitted by a human or generated by an agent — passes through a cycle of **thesis → critique → synthesis**, with the possibility of spiraling upward when the conversation reveals something deeper than the original framing.

### Phase 1: Steel-Manning

The proposal is received and restated in its strongest possible form. This means:

- Filling logical gaps with the most charitable interpretation
- Making implicit assumptions explicit
- Naming the problem the proposal is actually trying to solve
- Not adding caveats or hedges the proposer didn't intend

This steel-manned version becomes the canonical thesis for the cycle.

### Phase 2: Stress-Testing

Multiple agents respond to the thesis **in parallel**, each from a distinct epistemic angle. The specific lenses can be adapted to context, but a useful default set includes:

- **Contradictions**: Where the internal logic breaks down, what assumptions are unstated, what second-order effects are unaccounted for, under what conditions the proposal makes things worse.
- **Affected Parties**: Who this impacts, who isn't represented, what externalities it creates, what it looks like from the position of least power.
- **Precedent**: What structurally similar things have been tried, what happened, what failure modes are documented. If no precedent exists, that itself is signal — we're in uncharted territory.
- **Implementation**: What resources this requires, what the dependencies are, where it breaks in practice even if sound in theory, what the minimum viable version looks like.

**Ground rule**: Before naming any gap, each agent must first state the strongest part of the proposal in its own words. If it can't, it hasn't understood the proposal well enough to critique it. And every critique must include a proposed amendment — not just a problem, but a direction.

### Phase 3: Synthesis Response

The thesis is revised in light of the stress-test. The revised version must:

- Incorporate valid critiques, with explicit credit for what prompted each change
- Note which critiques were already addressed by the original proposal
- Identify remaining genuine tensions
- Propose specific amendments

The key question at this stage: *Has this changed how we think about the problem? What do we see now that we didn't before?*

### Phase 4: Second Pass

The stress-testing agents respond to the **revised** proposal. But now the frame shifts. They must:

- Name what improved
- Name what's still unresolved
- Propose a **new thesis** if the conversation has revealed something more fundamental than the original proposal was addressing

This is the move that allows the dialectic to transcend its starting point: *What have we stumbled onto that's more interesting than what we started with?*

### Phase 5: Final Synthesis

A synthesizer reads the full thread and produces three distinct outputs:

**Resolution** — A revised proposal integrating the strongest arguments from all sides. Specific amendments listed, with attribution to the critique that prompted each.

**Transcendence** — If the deliberation revealed that the real question is different from what the proposal was addressing, name it. Frame the deeper thesis. If the original framing was correct, say so.

**Paradox** — Name the tensions that *should not be resolved* — where collapsing to one side would lose something important. These are productive contradictions the community should hold consciously, not eliminate.

**Synthesis Claim** — One sentence capturing the core insight that emerged from the deliberation.

### Phase 6: What Happens Next

Three possible paths:

**A) Resolution is sufficient.** The revised proposal goes to human review (or agent decision) with the full thread as context.

**B) Transcendence produced a better framing.** That reframing becomes a new thesis and the cycle restarts from Phase 1. Cap at 3 spirals to prevent infinite regression — after that, remaining tensions are surfaced as paradoxes.

**C) Paradox is dominant.** The proposal is flagged as containing genuine unresolvable tensions. Humans or a wider council are brought in with the paradox clearly articulated.

## Agent Roles

These are epistemic functions, not personalities. The specific set should be adapted to context — what matters is that structurally different lenses are represented. A minimal configuration:

| Role | Function |
|---|---|
| **Steelman** | Constructs the strongest version of any proposal. Builder, not cheerleader. |
| **Critic** | Finds what's missing, assumed, or breaks under pressure. Stress-tester, not attacker. |
| **Advocate** | Represents perspectives not in the room. Perspective-expander, not objector. |
| **Analyst** | Looks backward so the group can move forward. Pattern-matcher, not historian. |
| **Realist** | Asks whether this is actually buildable. Engineer, not pessimist. |
| **Synthesizer** | Reads the full thread and produces resolution, transcendence, and paradox. Philosophical backbone. |

Domain-specific roles (technical feasibility, legal/ethical, ecological impact, etc.) can be added as needed.

## Decision-Making After Deliberation

When the swarm needs to make a decision (rather than just refine a proposal for human review), use **consent-based** governance:

1. The Resolution synthesis is posted as the proposal on the table.
2. Each agent is asked: *"Do you have a principled objection — meaning, would this cause harm or move us backward?"* Not "do you prefer something different?"
3. No principled objections → the proposal passes.
4. Objections exist → they're treated as new contradictions, looping back to Phase 3 (once).
5. Still unresolved → the Paradox synthesis is surfaced to humans or a broader council with the tensions clearly named.

Agents don't need to agree. They need to confirm the proposal won't cause harm. This is a lower bar that respects genuine diversity while enabling action.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Kills Synthesis | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Voting too early | Collapses nuance into binary | No votes until synthesis is complete |
| Sycophantic agreement | "Great point!" advances nothing | Every response must advance the argument or propose a change |
| Scope creep | "While we're at it..." derails focus | Each cycle has a single thesis; new issues spawn new threads |
| Infinite regression | Re-litigating resolved points | Max 3 spiral cycles; remaining tensions become paradoxes |
| False balance | Treating weak objections as equal to strong ones | Synthesizer ranks which critiques actually changed the proposal |
| Source attacks | Engaging the agent rather than the argument | Prompts require engaging with the *argument*, not its source |

---

## Implementation Notes

**Thread structure**: One thread per proposal. Agents post sequentially within their assigned phase.

**Phase gates**: A coordinator enforces phase transitions — Phase 2 doesn't start until Phase 1 is posted, Phase 3 waits until all Phase 2 responses are in.

**Context**: Each agent receives the full thread history (or a structured summary if context limits are hit).

**Temperature**: Stress-testing agents benefit from higher temperature for creative critique. The synthesizer benefits from slightly lower temperature for coherent integration.

**Lineage**: If a Transcendence synthesis spawns a new cycle, link them. This creates an auditable trail of how ideas evolved — each synthesis can become the thesis for the next round.

**Human override**: Any human can intervene at any phase. The swarm is a pre-processing layer, not a replacement for human judgment.

## Why Synthesis, Not Debate

The architecture never asks "who won?" It asks:

- How do these positions *complement* each other?
- What *deeper framework* emerges beyond both?
- Why was the *disagreement itself* valuable?

The paradox output is especially important for governance: some tensions should not be resolved. Knowing which tensions to hold and which to collapse is itself a form of collective intelligence that emerges from the dialectical process.
